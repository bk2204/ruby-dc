ruby-dc
=======

This is a reasonably complete version of dc.  It currently understands most
operators, including FreeBSD and GNU extensions, except the following:

* J
* M

== Goals

* A math library implementing at least the bc -l features.
* GNU features
* FreeBSD features
* A simple Ruby-to-dc converter

== Example

To generate the math library into dc code, run
`bin/dc-generator lib/dc/math/library.rb`.  This will produce a math library
containing at least the e(x) and l(x) functions from bc, using the @ register as
temporary storage.  The generated code should be suitable for both FreeBSD and
GNU dc implementations.
